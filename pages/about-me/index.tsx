        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
          <p>I'm 24, from Michigan originally, but after joining the Air Force at 19 I spent some time in Texas and then the United Kingdom.
            After my time in the U.K I moved back to the U.S and was stationed in Nevada, where I reside now. I really enjoyed my time in as
            an Avionics Technician and am so happy to be taking this next step as a Software Developer.
